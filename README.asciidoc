A Gradle-Eclipse skeleton project aiming to speed up the production of SmartGWT reproducible test cases.

It uses Gradle as a build automation tool integrated with the IDE. Hence if you want to use the IDE you need to 
install the great Gradle Eclipse tooling integration. You can still use only Gradle using its GUI or from command line.

How To
------
There are two alternative ways to use this project: from IDE or from CLI.

Eclipse/STS
~~~~~~~~~~~
. Install the Eclipse/http://www.springsource.org/downloads/sts-ggts[STS] Gradle tooling support
. Import this skeleton project from git
. Refresh gradle dependencies
. Edit gwt sources under the +src/main/java+ folder
. Launch the GWT Dev Mode using the _.launch_ script on the project root

Gradle
~~~~~~
* invoke +./gradlew --gui+ to obtain the Gradle GUI
* or invoke +./gradlew gwtDevMode+ to directly launch the GWT Dev Mode
