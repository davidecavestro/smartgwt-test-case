An Eclipse skeleton project aiming to speed up the production of SmartGWT reproducible test cases.

It uses Gradle as a build automation tool integrated with the IDE. Hence you need to 
install the great Gradle Eclipse tooling integration. 

How To
-------
. Install the Eclipse/http://www.springsource.org/downloads/sts-ggts[STS] Gradle tooling support
. Import this skeleton project from git
. Refresh gradle dependencies
. Edit gwt sources under the +src/main/java+ folder
. Launch the GWT Dev Mode using the _.launch_ script on the project root
