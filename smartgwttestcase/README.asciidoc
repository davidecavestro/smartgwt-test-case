A gradle-eclipse project to ease producing SmartGWT reproducible test cases.

It uses gradle as a build automation tool integrated with the IDE. Hence you need to 
install the great gradle eclipse tooling integration available as a plugin for http://www.springsource.org/downloads/sts-ggts[SpringSource Tool Suite].
